add text here just use it like a typewriter. and add as much and as little as you like.

new text appears here in a separate paragraph

use 2 or more blank spaces at the end of a single spaced line.

italic *text* like this

# Lists

## unordered lists

* Item 1

## ordered lists

1. Item 1

# Fencing

in line fencing with a backtick `to show anything in plain text with *no* formatting` which can be useful for many things

in line execution of r code inside the backtick by inserting r as the first element `r 3 +pi`

in line execution of r code inside the backtick by inserting r as the first element ` 3 +pi`

3 backticks for a whole section of plain text

```
everything in here is in plain text, even single lines.

useful especially when showing other coding instructions.

# LaTex code for equations

we set off equations with `$` for brackets

## Inline equations

these equations such as $a = 3 + 4$ will appear inside a single line of text.

these equations such as $$a = 3 + 4$$ will appear in a separate line of their own.

## Subscripts

$$H_0 = Z_{a + b}$$

## Superscripts

$$S = cA^z$$

elements can be coupled and nested

$$S=cA^z_1 + z_{2 + x}$$

## fractions and Greek symbols

$$\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\delta + \gamma_x}$$

## Summation signs

$$z= \sum_{i=1}^X{K}$$

## Escape the backslash with a custom term

$$\backslash \alpha \le b \backslash$$

## rendering plaintext in a LaTex equation

$$P{Occurence of Species A} = Z$$

$$P(\mbox{Ocurrence of Species A}) = Z$$

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# don't forget to start with comments
# preliminaries
library(ggplot2)

pred <- 1:10 # vector of 10 integers
res <- runif(10) # random uniform values

# print the random numbers
print(res)

# plot the graph
qplot(x=pred,y=res)

```

now back to writing text in our markdown document, including LaTex equations if we need them such as $a + b$ inserted in the middle of my sentence
